# SQLAlchemy-Tutorial
---
This repository is dedicated to providing a foundational understanding of SQLAlchemy, an open-source SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. Through this tutorial, I share my personal journey and insights into the world of SQLAlchemy.

**Introduction**
SQLAlchemy offers a set of high-level API to communicate with relational databases. This means you can interact with your SQL database, as if you were using SQL commands, but instead, you'll be using Python methods and properties.

**Prerequisites**
Basic knowledge of Python
Familiarity with SQL is helpful but not mandatory

**3 Simple Examples**
T1. Will Explain Fundamentals
